# React Sudoku

*Note:** Not production ready

## Notes

Uses [electron](#todo), [react](#todo), and [webpack](#todo).



## Pre-requesites

 * [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) `gem install foreman` (I may look into the [node foreman](https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman) project to keep things in the npm world)
 * NodeJS


```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

(You can change the port by setting an env variable PORT=*80* )

## TODO and other things

To see why it's broken right now:

```bash
coffee scratch-pad/solve.coffee
```
